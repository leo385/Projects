#ABOUT ME

Hi, As you've seen my description and I made you sure that i really like programming in kind of diffrent languages.
The most i'm interested, how the games are created, how it's possible that we can play multiplayer with each other?
I'm interesting also how the websites can being attacked, diffrent ways to get other password, how to ddos, etc.
My favourite programming language is cpp, because we have more control at our projects, we can manage RAM by pointers.
In cpp we've got many programming method like object programming, function programming, structured programming, etc and that's beautiful :)

#WHAT IS INSIDE PROJECT'S FOLDER

There are many projects like 'SFML Games', 'SDL Games', 'OpenGL Games', maybe projects from Unreal Engine in future.
You can find also applications there, written in python, like "automatic filling form bots on website'.
In future I'll figure out to make some kind of cheats to computer games, i mean 'trainers' by using cpp or c#, it's depending from my comfortable.
