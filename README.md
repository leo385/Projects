It's my first ball game project, if you've played a website game, called "Haxball", you should know that i've created a similar game to that :)
If you'd like to know how this game works, you should check out updates release. There are some descriptions about release.

ðŸ‘‰ABOUT MEðŸ‘ˆ

Hi, I started since 2012 with programming as a kid. As you've seen my description and I made you sure that i really like programming in kind of diffrent languages.
The most i'm interested, how the games are created, how it's possible that we can play multiplayer with each other?
I'm interesting also how the websites can being attacked, diffrent ways to get other password, how to ddos, etc.
My favourite programming language is cpp, because we have more control at our projects, we can manage RAM by pointers.
In cpp we've got many programming methods like object programming, functional programming, structural programming, etc and that's beautiful :)

ðŸ‘‰WHAT'S GONNA BE INSIDE ANOTHER REPOSITORIESðŸ‘ˆ

There are many projects like 'SFML Games', 'OpenGL Games', Simulations.
In future I'll figure out to make some kind of cheats to computer games, i mean 'trainers' by using cpp or c#, it's depending from my comfortable.

My main goal is make a game engine and be satisfied that.
